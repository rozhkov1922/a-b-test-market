A/B test 

Using the data of the online store, prioritize hypotheses, evaluate the results of A / B testing using various methods

Hypotheses were prioritized by ICE and RICE frameworks. Then I did an analysis
A/B test results, plotted cumulative revenue, average bill,
conversions by group, and then calculated the statistical significance of differences in conversions
and average bills for raw and cleaned data. Based on my analysis, I
a decision was made that further testing was not advisable.
